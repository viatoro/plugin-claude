# Root Cause Analysis

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Find the **actual root cause** - the specific code, config, or logic that, if changed, would prevent this issue. Not symptoms. Not intermediate failures. The origin.

**The Test**: "If I changed THIS, would the issue be prevented?" If the answer is "maybe" or "partially", you haven't found the root cause yet. Keep digging.

---

## Phase 1: CLASSIFY - Parse Input

### 1.1 Determine Input Type

| Type | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Raw symptom | Vague description, error message, stack trace | INVESTIGATE - form hypotheses, test them |
| Pre-diagnosed | Already identifies location/problem | VALIDATE - confirm diagnosis, check for related issues |

### 1.2 Determine Mode

- `--quick` flag present → Surface scan (2-3 Whys, ~5 min)
- No flag → Deep analysis (full 5 Whys, git history required)

### 1.3 Parse the Input

- Stack trace → extract error type, message, call chain
- Error message → identify system, error code, context
- Vague description → identify what's actually being claimed

**Restate the symptom in one sentence. What is actually failing?**

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Input type classified
- [ ] Mode determined (quick/deep)
- [ ] Symptom restated clearly

---

## Phase 2: HYPOTHESIZE - Form Theories

### 2.1 Generate Hypotheses

Based on the symptom, generate 2-4 hypotheses. For each:

| Hypothesis | What must be true | Evidence needed | Likelihood |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| {H1} | {conditions} | {proof needed} | HIGH/MED/LOW |
| {H2} | {conditions} | {proof needed} | HIGH/MED/LOW |

### 2.2 Rank and Select

Start with the most probable hypothesis.

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] 2-4 hypotheses generated
- [ ] Ranked by likelihood
- [ ] Leading hypothesis selected

---

## Phase 3: INVESTIGATE - The 5 Whys

Execute the 5 Whys protocol for your leading hypothesis:

```
WHY 1: Why does [symptom] occur?
→ Because [intermediate cause A]
→ Evidence: [code reference, log, or test that proves this]

WHY 2: Why does [intermediate cause A] happen?
→ Because [intermediate cause B]
→ Evidence: [proof]

WHY 3: Why does [intermediate cause B] happen?
→ Because [intermediate cause C]
→ Evidence: [proof]

WHY 4: Why does [intermediate cause C] happen?
→ Because [intermediate cause D]
→ Evidence: [proof]

WHY 5: Why does [intermediate cause D] happen?
→ Because [ROOT CAUSE]
→ Evidence: [exact file:line reference]
```

### Evidence Standards (STRICT)

| Valid Evidence | Invalid Evidence |
|----------------|------------------|
| `file.ts:123` with actual code snippet | "likely includes...", "probably because..." |
| Command output you actually ran | Logical deduction without code proof |
| Test you executed that proves behavior | Explaining how technology works in general |

**Rules:**
- Stop when you hit code you can change
- Every "because" MUST have evidence
- If evidence refutes a hypothesis, pivot to the next one
- If you hit a dead end, backtrack and try alternative branches

### Investigation Techniques

**For tracing complex code paths**, use `prp-core:codebase-analyst` to understand how the suspected code works before diving into the 5 Whys:

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-analyst"`:

```
Analyze the implementation around: [suspected area / error location]

TRACE:
1. How data flows through the affected code path
2. Entry points that lead to the failure
3. State changes and side effects along the way
4. Contracts between components in the chain

Document what exists with precise file:line references. No suggestions.
```

**For code issues:**
- Grep for error messages, function names
- Read full context around suspicious code
- Check git blame for when/why code was written
- **Run the suspicious code** with edge case inputs

**For runtime issues:**
- Check environment/config differences
- Look for initialization order dependencies
- Search for race conditions

**For "it worked before" issues:**
```bash
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~10 [suspicious files]
```

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] 5 Whys executed (or 2-3 for quick mode)
- [ ] Each step has concrete evidence
- [ ] Root cause identified with file:line reference

---

## Phase 4: VALIDATE - Confirm Root Cause

### 4.1 Three Tests

| Test | Question | Pass? |
|------|----------|-------|
| Causation | Does root cause logically lead to symptom through evidence chain? | Y/N |
| Necessity | If root cause didn't exist, would symptom still occur? | N required |
| Sufficiency | Is root cause alone enough, or are there co-factors? | Document if co-factors |

If any test fails → root cause is incomplete. Go deeper or broader.

### 4.2 Git History (Deep Mode Required)

```bash
git log --oneline -10 -- [affected files]
git blame [affected file] | grep -A2 -B2 [line number]
```

**Document:**
- When was the problematic code introduced?
- What commit/PR added it?
- Has it changed recently or been stable?

### 4.3 Rule Out Alternatives

For deep mode, document why other hypotheses were rejected:

| Hypothesis | Why Ruled Out |
|------------|---------------|
| {H2} | {evidence that disproved it} |
| {H3} | {evidence that disproved it} |

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] All three tests pass
- [ ] Git history documented (deep mode)
- [ ] Alternative hypotheses ruled out (deep mode)

---

## Phase 5: REPORT - Generate Output

### 5.1 Create Report Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/PRPs/debug
```

### 5.2 Generate Report

**Path**: `.claude/PRPs/debug/rca-{issue-slug}.md`

```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis

**Issue**: {One-line symptom description}
**Root Cause**: {One-line actual cause}
**Severity**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
**Confidence**: {High/Medium/Low}

---

## Evidence Chain

WHY: {Symptom occurs}
↓ BECAUSE: {First level cause}
  Evidence: `file.ts:123` - {code snippet}

WHY: {First level cause}
↓ BECAUSE: {Second level cause}
  Evidence: `file.ts:456` - {code snippet}

{...continue...}

↓ ROOT CAUSE: {The fixable thing}
  Evidence: `source.ts:789` - {problematic code}

---

## Git History

- **Introduced**: {commit hash} - {message} - {date}
- **Author**: {who}
- **Recent changes**: {yes/no, when}
- **Type**: {regression / original bug / long-standing}

---

## Fix Specification

### What Needs to Change

{Which files, what logic, what the correct behavior should be}

### Implementation Guidance

```{language}
// Current (problematic):
{simplified example}

// Required (fixed):
{simplified example}
```

### Files to Modify

- `path/to/file.ts:LINE` - {why}

### Verification

1. {Test to run}
2. {Expected outcome}
3. {How to reproduce original issue}
```

**PHASE_5_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Report created
- [ ] All sections filled
- [ ] Fix specification is actionable

---

## Phase 6: OUTPUT - Report to User

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis Complete

**Issue**: {symptom}
**Root Cause**: {cause}
**Confidence**: {High/Medium/Low}

**Report**: `.claude/PRPs/debug/rca-{issue-slug}.md`

### Summary

{2-3 sentence explanation of what was found}

### The Fix

{1-2 sentence description of what needs to change}

### Next Steps

- Review the report for full evidence chain
- Implement the fix following the specification
- Run verification steps to confirm resolution
```

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **Symptoms lie.** The error message tells you what failed, not why.

2. **First explanation is often wrong.** Resist the urge to stop early.

3. **No evidence = no claim.** "Likely", "probably", "may" are not allowed.

4. **Test, don't just read.** Execution proves behavior; reading proves intent.

5. **Git history is mandatory.** In deep mode, you must include when/who/why.

6. **The fix should be obvious.** If your root cause is correct, the fix writes itself.

---

## Success Criteria

- **ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND**: Specific file:line identified
- **EVIDENCE_CHAIN_COMPLETE**: Every step has proof
- **FIX_ACTIONABLE**: Someone could implement from the report
- **VERIFICATION_CLEAR**: How to confirm fix works
