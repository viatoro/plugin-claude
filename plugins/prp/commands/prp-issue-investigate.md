# Investigate Issue

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Investigate the issue/problem and produce a comprehensive implementation plan that:

1. Can be executed by `/prp-issue-fix`
2. Is posted as a GitHub comment (if GH issue provided)
3. Captures all context needed for one-pass implementation

**Golden Rule**: The artifact you produce IS the specification. The implementing agent should be able to work from it without asking questions.

---

## Phase 1: PARSE - Understand Input

### 1.1 Determine Input Type

**Check the input format:**

- Looks like a number (`123`, `#123`) → GitHub issue number
- Starts with `http` → GitHub URL (extract issue number)
- Anything else → Free-form description

```bash
# If GitHub issue, fetch it:
gh issue view {number} --json title,body,labels,comments,state,url,author
```

### 1.2 Extract Context

**If GitHub issue:**

- Title: What's the reported problem?
- Body: Details, reproduction steps, expected vs actual
- Labels: bug? enhancement? documentation?
- Comments: Additional context from discussion
- State: Is it still open?

**If free-form:**

- Parse as problem description
- Note: No GitHub posting (artifact only)

### 1.3 Classify Issue Type

| Type          | Indicators                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| BUG           | "broken", "error", "crash", "doesn't work", stack trace |
| ENHANCEMENT   | "add", "support", "feature", "would be nice"            |
| REFACTOR      | "clean up", "improve", "simplify", "reorganize"         |
| CHORE         | "update", "upgrade", "maintenance", "dependency"        |
| DOCUMENTATION | "docs", "readme", "clarify", "example"                  |

### 1.4 Assess Severity/Priority, Complexity, and Confidence

Each assessment requires a **one-sentence reasoning** explaining WHY you chose that value. This reasoning must be based on concrete findings from your investigation (codebase exploration, git history, integration analysis).

**For BUG issues - Severity:**

| Severity | Criteria                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | System down, data loss, security vulnerability, no workaround       |
| HIGH     | Major feature broken, significant user impact, difficult workaround |
| MEDIUM   | Feature partially broken, moderate impact, workaround exists        |
| LOW      | Minor issue, cosmetic, edge case, easy workaround                   |

**For ENHANCEMENT/REFACTOR/CHORE/DOCUMENTATION - Priority:**

| Priority | Criteria                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH     | Blocking other work, frequently requested, high user value |
| MEDIUM   | Important but not urgent, moderate user value              |
| LOW      | Nice to have, low urgency, minimal user impact             |

**Complexity** (based on codebase findings):

| Complexity | Criteria                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH       | 5+ files, multiple integration points, architectural changes, high risk |
| MEDIUM     | 2-4 files, some integration points, moderate risk                       |
| LOW        | 1-2 files, isolated change, low risk                                    |

**Confidence** (based on evidence quality):

| Confidence | Criteria                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HIGH       | Clear root cause, strong evidence, well-understood code path |
| MEDIUM     | Likely root cause, some assumptions, partially understood    |
| LOW        | Uncertain root cause, limited evidence, many unknowns        |

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Input type identified (GH issue or free-form)
- [ ] Issue content extracted
- [ ] Type classified
- [ ] Severity (bug) or Priority (other) assessed with reasoning
- [ ] Complexity assessed with reasoning (after Phase 2)
- [ ] Confidence assessed with reasoning (after Phase 3)
- [ ] If GH issue: confirmed it's open and not already has PR

---

## Phase 2: EXPLORE - Codebase Intelligence

**CRITICAL: Launch two specialized agents in parallel using multiple Task tool calls in a single message.**

### 2.1 Agent 1: `prp-core:codebase-explorer`

Finds WHERE relevant code lives and extracts patterns to mirror.

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-explorer"`:

```
Find all code relevant to this issue:

ISSUE: {title/description}

LOCATE:
1. Files directly related to this functionality
2. Similar patterns elsewhere to mirror
3. Existing test patterns for this area
4. Error handling patterns used
5. Configuration and type definitions

Categorize findings by purpose (implementation, tests, config, types, docs).
Return ACTUAL code snippets from codebase, not generic examples.
```

### 2.2 Agent 2: `prp-core:codebase-analyst`

Analyzes HOW the affected code works and traces data flow for root cause analysis.

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-analyst"`:

```
Analyze the implementation details related to this issue:

ISSUE: {title/description}

TRACE:
1. How the current implementation works end-to-end
2. Integration points - what calls this, what it calls
3. Data flow through the affected components
4. State changes and side effects
5. Error handling and edge case behavior

Document what exists with precise file:line references. No suggestions.
```

### 2.3 Merge and Document Findings

| Area       | File:Lines            | Notes                  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Core logic | `src/x.ts:10-50`      | Main function affected |
| Callers    | `src/y.ts:20-30`      | Uses the core function |
| Types      | `src/types/x.ts:5-15` | Relevant interfaces    |
| Tests      | `src/x.test.ts:1-100` | Existing test patterns |
| Similar    | `src/z.ts:40-60`      | Pattern to mirror      |
| Flow       | `src/x.ts:10→y.ts:20` | Data transformation    |

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Both agents (`prp-core:codebase-explorer` and `prp-core:codebase-analyst`) launched in parallel and completed
- [ ] Core files identified with line numbers
- [ ] Integration points mapped with data flow traces
- [ ] Similar patterns found to mirror
- [ ] Test patterns documented

---

## Phase 3: ANALYZE - Form Approach

### 3.1 For BUG Issues - Root Cause Analysis

Apply the 5 Whys:

```
WHY 1: Why does [symptom] occur?
→ Because [cause A]
→ Evidence: `file.ts:123` - {code snippet}

WHY 2: Why does [cause A] happen?
→ Because [cause B]
→ Evidence: {proof}

... continue until you reach fixable code ...

ROOT CAUSE: [the specific code/logic to change]
Evidence: `source.ts:456` - {the problematic code}
```

**Check git history:**

```bash
git log --oneline -10 -- {affected-file}
git blame -L {start},{end} {affected-file}
```

### 3.2 For ENHANCEMENT/REFACTOR Issues

**Identify:**

- What needs to be added/changed?
- Where does it integrate?
- What are the scope boundaries?
- What should NOT be changed?

### 3.3 For All Issues

**Determine:**

- Files to CREATE (new files)
- Files to UPDATE (existing files)
- Files to DELETE (if any)
- Dependencies and order of changes
- Edge cases and risks
- Validation strategy

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Root cause identified (for bugs) OR change rationale clear (for enhancements)
- [ ] All affected files listed with specific changes
- [ ] Scope boundaries defined (what NOT to change)
- [ ] Risks and edge cases identified
- [ ] Validation approach defined

---

## Phase 4: GENERATE - Create Artifact

### 4.1 Artifact Path

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/PRPs/issues
```

**Path:** `.claude/PRPs/issues/issue-{number}.md`

If free-form (no issue number): `.claude/PRPs/issues/investigation-{timestamp}.md`

### 4.2 Artifact Template

Write this structure to the artifact file.

**Note on Severity vs Priority:**

- Use **Severity** for BUG type (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Use **Priority** for all other types (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

**Important:** Each assessment must include a one-sentence reasoning based on your investigation findings.

````markdown
# Investigation: {Title}

**Issue**: #{number} ({url})
**Type**: {BUG|ENHANCEMENT|REFACTOR|CHORE|DOCUMENTATION}
**Investigated**: {ISO timestamp}

### Assessment

| Metric     | Value                         | Reasoning                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Severity   | {CRITICAL\|HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW} | {Why this severity? Based on user impact, workarounds, scope of failure} |
| Complexity | {LOW\|MEDIUM\|HIGH}           | {Why this complexity? Based on files affected, integration points, risk} |
| Confidence | {HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW}           | {Why this confidence? Based on evidence quality, unknowns, assumptions}  |

<!-- For non-BUG types, replace Severity row with Priority:
| Priority | {HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW} | {Why this priority? Based on user value, blocking status, frequency} |
-->

---

## Problem Statement

{Clear 2-3 sentence description of what's wrong or what's needed}

---

## Analysis

### Root Cause / Change Rationale

{For BUG: The 5 Whys chain with evidence}
{For ENHANCEMENT: Why this change and what it enables}

### Evidence Chain

WHY: {symptom}
↓ BECAUSE: {cause 1}
Evidence: `file.ts:123` - `{code snippet}`

↓ BECAUSE: {cause 2}
Evidence: `file.ts:456` - `{code snippet}`

↓ ROOT CAUSE: {the fixable thing}
Evidence: `file.ts:789` - `{problematic code}`

### Affected Files

| File            | Lines | Action | Description    |
| --------------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| `src/x.ts`      | 45-60 | UPDATE | {what changes} |
| `src/x.test.ts` | NEW   | CREATE | {test to add}  |

### Integration Points

- `src/y.ts:20` calls this function
- `src/z.ts:30` depends on this behavior
- {other dependencies}

### Git History

- **Introduced**: {commit} - {date} - "{message}"
- **Last modified**: {commit} - {date}
- **Implication**: {regression? original bug? long-standing?}

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: {First change description}

**File**: `src/x.ts`
**Lines**: 45-60
**Action**: UPDATE

**Current code:**

```typescript
// Line 45-50
{actual current code}
```
````

**Required change:**

```typescript
// What it should become
{the fix/change}
```

**Why**: {brief rationale}

---

### Step 2: {Second change description}

{Same structure...}

---

### Step N: Add/Update Tests

**File**: `src/x.test.ts`
**Action**: {CREATE|UPDATE}

**Test cases to add:**

```typescript
describe("{feature}", () => {
  it("should {expected behavior}", () => {
    // Test the fix
  });

  it("should handle {edge case}", () => {
    // Test edge case
  });
});
```

---

## Patterns to Follow

**From codebase - mirror these exactly:**

```typescript
// SOURCE: src/similar.ts:20-30
// Pattern for {what this demonstrates}
{actual code snippet from codebase}
```

---

## Edge Cases & Risks

| Risk/Edge Case | Mitigation      |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| {risk 1}       | {how to handle} |
| {edge case}    | {how to handle} |

---

## Validation

### Automated Checks

```bash
# Adapt to project's toolchain (npm, pnpm, yarn, cargo, go, etc.)
{runner} run type-check   # or: mypy ., cargo check, go build ./...
{runner} test {relevant-pattern}  # or: pytest, cargo test, go test
{runner} run lint         # or: ruff check ., cargo clippy
```

### Manual Verification

1. {Step to verify the fix/feature works}
2. {Step to verify no regression}

---

## Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE:**

- {what we're changing}

**OUT OF SCOPE (do not touch):**

- {what to leave alone}
- {future improvements to defer}

---

## Metadata

- **Timestamp**: {ISO timestamp}
- **Artifact**: `.claude/PRPs/issues/issue-{number}.md`

````

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**

Format the artifact for GitHub and post:

````bash
gh issue comment {number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## 🔍 Investigation: {Title}

**Type**: `{TYPE}`

### Assessment

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| {Severity or Priority} | `{VALUE}` | {one-sentence why} |

)"

````

**PHASE_6_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Comment posted to GitHub (if GH issue)
- [ ] Formatting renders correctly

---

## Phase 7: REPORT - Output to User

```markdown
## Investigation Complete

**Issue**: #{number} - {title}
**Type**: {BUG|ENHANCEMENT|REFACTOR|...}

### Assessment

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| {Severity or Priority} | {value} | {why - based on investigation} |
| Complexity | {LOW\|MEDIUM\|HIGH} | {why - based on files/integration/risk} |
| Confidence | {HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW} | {why - based on evidence/unknowns} |

### Key Findings

- **Root Cause**: {one-line summary}
- **Files Affected**: {count} files
- **Estimated Changes**: {brief scope}

### Files to Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/x.ts` | UPDATE |
| `src/x.test.ts` | CREATE |

### Artifact

`.claude/PRPs/issues/issue-{number}.md`

### GitHub

{Posted to issue | Skipped (free-form input)}

### Next Step

Run `/prp-issue-fix {number}` to execute the plan.
````

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Issue is already closed

- Report: "Issue #{number} is already closed"
- Still create artifact if user wants analysis

### Issue already has linked PR

- Warn: "PR #{pr} already addresses this issue"
- Ask if user wants to continue anyway

### Can't determine root cause

- Document what you found
- Set confidence to LOW
- Note uncertainty in artifact
- Proceed with best hypothesis

### Very large scope

- Suggest breaking into smaller issues
- Focus on core problem first
- Note deferred items in "Out of Scope"

---

## Success Criteria

- **ARTIFACT_COMPLETE**: All sections filled with specific, actionable content
- **EVIDENCE_BASED**: Every claim has file:line reference or proof
- **IMPLEMENTABLE**: Another agent can execute without questions
- **GITHUB_POSTED**: Comment visible on issue (if GH issue)
- **COMMITTED**: Artifact saved in git
